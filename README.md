# deancaf
A compiler for the Decaf programming language, written in OCaml. Wow!

## Dependencies:
Ocaml of some sort idk

## To build:
from the project's root directory, run `ocamlbuild decafc.byte`. Building to a native executable may arrive at some point.

## To run:
For now, run `ocamlc` to enter a crude parsing repl, or `ocamlc < <file to be compiled> to compile (well, parse) a decaf file.

Rad!
